The default farm size of 3x3 may feel a bit small. Upgrading the size of the farm will be needed for optimal production of resources on the map. If you want to see the area covered by a MFR machine hold a hammer in your hand. The hammer can also be used to rotate MFR machines and to pick the machine up while retaining the energy inside the machine. Make sure you upgrade your harvesters and planters the same way.
