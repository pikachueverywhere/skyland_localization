Now that we have decided not to go back in the Nether again we'll need a different way of obtaining blaze rods. Dolls have amazing summoning powers in this pack. Placing an angry doll in a stone barrel of lava will summon a Blaze, while placing a creepy doll in a barrel of witch water will summon an enderman.Once you collect enough ender pearls for a reusable safari net you can capture these mobs and use an Auto Spawner to generate mob parts for your laboratory.
