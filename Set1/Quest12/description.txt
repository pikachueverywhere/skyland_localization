From this point on you will need more and more power to automate machines and farms and gather the resources needed to expand your world and rebuild a mighty civilization. There are many ways of getting power in this pack. Steam dynamos will produce power from water and coal. Magmatic dynamos can be fed lava from crucibles. BioReactors will be most efficient when you have 9 different types of seeds or saplings being fed into them. Use ducts to move the resulting BioFuel into BioReactors or Compression Dynamos to obtain power. The culinary generator from Extra Utilities will produce more power if you feed it better meals. If you have an ender farm ender generators are not a bad option. All machines on this map can be powered using RF through conduits. TheForestry and Extra Bee machines will need conduits between them and the power source. Conduits will convert the RF to MJ when the machine needs it. To fill a flux capacitor you will need to make an Energetic Infuser.
