This book is a new invention from VSWE, ScottWears and LordDusk. You may be wondering how to use this book. On the off chance that you have no idea what you are doing this very small series of quests will give you a few guidelines. First off if you right click on any page you will go back to the previous page/menu. If a quest is dark it is locked and you will ned to complete one or more quests to unlock the quest. In the first menu of this book you should have noticed several numbered sets of quests, some of which are locked. You will have to complete quests found in a different set to unlock new sets of quests. There are several types of tasks and 3 ways to submit quests for completion. The first type of quest is the crafting quest. This quest will tell you to craft a specific item or block. Once you craft the required item in any crafting grid the book will update the quest completion. The third way of submitting items for completion is called Detection. Have the item in your inventory and press "Manual Detect" and the book will see you have the item and the quest will complete if all the tasks are done.
