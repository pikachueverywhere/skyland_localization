By this point you may have gotten tired of crafting crushed ores into ore blocks, and you may want a simpler solution. The Forest Barber has created a simple solution. The AutoPackager is not as configurable as the Cyclic Assembler and Fluidcrafter. It does one task, any item in a chest to the left of the Packager will be crafted into the first 2x2 or 3x3 recipe available for that material and the result will be placed in a chest to the right of the Packager. The Packager requires RF to run so you will need to hook it into your power system.  This is perfect for crafting ore blocks and metal storage blocks. Some recipes may not work since you can't configure which output it picks. Testing will be needed to find the best uses for this simple block.
