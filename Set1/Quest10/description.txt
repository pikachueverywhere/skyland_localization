The nether has many ores and other resources you can collect. It is however inhabited by many unsavoury characters. Your friendly map creator recommends large numbers of potions if you plan to head into the depths. You really should visit at least once to fully experience the joys of this map. Please note you do not HAVE to go to the nether. This map can be completed without ever entering the nether.
