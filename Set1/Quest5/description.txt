Mushrooms are a great source of food. Sift sand until you recieve "Ancient Spores". Plant these spores on a dirt block near a barrel filled with water to start turning the water into witch water. While the water in the barrel turns into witch water mushrooms will spawn on the mycellium. Placing sand in a barrel of witch water will make soul sand. Sifting soul sand can give you nether plants and resources. Placing a creepy doll in a barrel of witch water will spawn an enderman.
