Your first ore processing will be done using a smeltery from Tinker's Construct. You should have a book in your inventory titled "Materials and Me". This book will help you learn how to use Tinker's Construct. There are 2 other books in this series that will be magically ported to your hands from mDiyo's library when you complete certain tasks. They will explain how to build a smeltery and how to make alloys and powerful personalized tools. To get started you will need to make grout from clay, gravel and sand. Lava can be moved into the smeltery by using a clay bucket.
