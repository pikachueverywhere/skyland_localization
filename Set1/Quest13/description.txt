Sometimes you run low on food. To prevent starvation bugs can be eaten. While not very filling enough bugs can keep you from dying of hunger. Make a sifter from Mariculture. Place it in an open area. Toss rotten flesh, leaves, and saplings into the sifter. Eat the results. You can use the maggots, ants and other bait produced by the sifter with a reed fishing rod or any other mariculture fishing rod to catch fish for breeding.
