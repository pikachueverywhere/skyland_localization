Transfering power between power providers and machines can be done in multiple ways. Energy Cells can be used as portable power storage to move between machines that do not need a constant source of power. Conduits come in 3 tiers that can move different ammounts of power. The top tier can move 10k RF per tick per connection point. MFR rednet energy cables can move RF, EU and will convert to MJ when connected to a machine that requires MJ. They also trasnmit redstone signals. Make sure you use a wrench or hammer to set the connection type of the cable or you may find your machines not turning on because they are recieving a redstone signal from further away.
