Plastic is a key component in creating the machines you will need for farming and automation on the map. Rubber seeds can be gotten by sieving dirt. Or if you would prefer, you can craft a rubber sapling by combining any slime ball (slime,glue,blood) and any sapling. Processing the rubber from these trees into plastic will start your steps towards farming and automation.
