The final way of turning in quests is the Quest delivery system. This block will require you to send the items through a hopper or duct attached to the block. AE busses can also send items to the delivery system. Before you send items to the system you will need to key the system to the quest. Do so by selecting "Select Task" button in the lower right of the task page. Then right click the Quest delivery system with the book and you should see a message in chat saying the quest has been assigned to the system. Now place the hopper on top of the block and place the requested items in the hopper. The QDS will void all extra items not needed for quest completion. This is the only way to turn in quests that require fluids. You will need to use ducts to put the fluids into the delivery system. You can have multiple QDS assigned to different mods. Part of this quest is the ability to earn extra lives. You can combine heart pieces into full hearts. Right clicking with a heart will add 1 life to your total.
