The final step towards achieving ore is to combine pulverized ore into ore dust. This is not the same pulverized ore as the Thermal Expansion pulverized ore. 4 of these will make 1 ore dust which when processed in a smeltery will give you 2 ingots. You can also pulverize this dust in a pulverizer. The ore dust is the equivalent of vanilla ore. Treat it the same way you would treat the ore you mined out of the world.
