To create more powerful tools and weapons you will need to make casts for forming molten metal into tool parts. Use the wooden patterns to make stone parts of the tool pieces you wish to make casts of. Right click a casting table with a stone part and pour aluminum brass or gold over them to form casts. A seared brick or regular brick will make an ingot cast. Combine cast parts into tools with the tool station or tool forge.
