To get started processing the various materials on the map and eventually powering the many machines you will need lava. Lava is created by melting cobble in a crucible over a heat source. Torches, lava, and lit netherrack all work as heat sources. Clay buckets can be created and used to move fluids. A clay bucket can move any fluid except lava as often as you want. Once you move lava the clay will break from the heat. Move water for your cobble gen before moving the lava or be prepared to make more clay buckets.
