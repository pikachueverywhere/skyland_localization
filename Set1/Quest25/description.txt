Fluiducts from Thermal Expansion can be used to pull molten metals out of the smeltery and into casting basins or tables. Using a redstone signal you can toggle the fluiduct on and off. Alternatively you can attach a servo to the fluiduct and set the fluiduct to ignore redstone signal. In this state the fluiduct will just keep pouring molten metal from the smeltery drain into the casts. Advanced automation can be done with multiple drains, fluiducts basins and whitelisting different molten metals.
