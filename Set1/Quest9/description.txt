Eventually you may get tired of moving water around in buckets. An Aqueous Accumulator can produce water very slowly out of thin air. Place a source block on at least 2 sides to speed up the water production and then use ducts to move it where it needs to go.  A sprinkler from Open Blocks can be placed on top of an aqueous accumulator to hydrate and fertilize farms. As you get tired of sifting by hand try using Autonomous Activators to do your clicking for you. Place up to 3 facing the sieve and set them to "right click" mode. Fill the inventory with the blocks you want to sift then walk away. You'll need a Vacuum Hopper to automate the collection of the resources obtained from sieving so don't walk too far away until you have one of those sucking up the ore chunks.
