While sifting dirt you may have gotten some grass seeds. If not keep sifting dirt until you do. Create a platform at least 6x6 out of dirt 24 -30 blocks away from your base and plant the grass seed on one of the blocks. Wait for passive mobs to spawn. In a different area create a mob spawner at least 35 blocks away from your base and dark for spawning and killing hostile mobs for their body parts. Rotten meat can be composted into dirt in the barrels. Bonemeal is also very useful. Once you have a cow you can place a bucket of milk in a barrel of water to create slime. If you have not gotten a rubber seed from sifting dirt you can craft a rubber sapling by combining a slime ball with any other sapling.
