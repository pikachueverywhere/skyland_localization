To start in bee breeding you need to take a female (Princess) and a male (Drone) and combine them in a apiary, alveary or bee house. The first mutation you need to find is the "Common" bee. Common bees are created by mutating 2 bees of different "hive" species. Any bee you can get from breaking a hive with a scoop is a "hive" bee. Take 2 different hive bees and place the princess in the top slot of the apiary or alveary and the drone in the bottom. Wait for the bees to finish dying. At this point a new princess and a drone or 3 will show up in the storage section of the apiary or alveary. You will need to scan them to find out what species they are since hybrid half and half bees are possible. You want to get pure "Common" bees. Any 2 different hive bees can mutate to Common. Try a Forest Princess and a Meadows Drone. If the apiary takes too long you can skip the time delay by using a mutatron, but you will need a power system in place to do so.
