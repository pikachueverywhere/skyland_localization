The second species of bee you will need to create is the "Cultivated" Bee. Any "hive" bee bred with a "Common" bee has a chance to mutate to a Cultivated bee. If you ever need to see what bee types can be bred to make other bee types use NEI or press the recipe arrow in the Mutatron. Breeding pure cultivated bees can be tricky. Sometimes you will get a Cultivated/Common bee when attempting to get pure cultivated bees. Cultivated and Common when combined give different mutations. When trying to breed cultivated bees it is best not to use cultivated/common hybrids.
