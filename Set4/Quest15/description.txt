Bee breeding is a scary science according to some. Luckily for you the Jaded One has agreed to add some guidance. Bees can be mutated in Apiaries and Alvearies or in the Mutatron. When breeding bees in an apiary or alveary you need to have the correct flower in the area to make the bees do their work. If you place a drop of honey in the top slot of a beealyzer and an unscanned bee in the next slot it will tell you what genes the bee has including what flower it wants. Flower = rose or dandelion , Nether = netherwart, Jungle = vine or fern, Desert = cactus, Magic = Thaumcraft flowers. Holding shift while mousing over a scanned bee will also tell you the flower they want. Make sure that flower is near the apiary you put the princess in. Like any other gene you can pull the flower gene off of one bee and place it on another either by using gendustry or extra bees. In this manner you can get nether bees that want regular flowers.
