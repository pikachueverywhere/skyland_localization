To breed trees you will need to collect pollen from different trees and combine the pollen either in the Mutatron from gendustry or by right clicking the leaves of a tree you wish to breed. Different species of trees can be created using this method. You can even create cross species that grow faster, bigger and produce more fuel when processed in a fermenter. You will need a sieve to collect pollen using bees and a grafter to get the mutated saplings from trees. Butterflies can also mutate trees. You will need special glasses to see when leaves have mutated. The best bees for mutating trees are the Jaded, Rural and Aura bees.
