The first step towards breeding a massive army of bees is to get to the Cultivated bee species. First you will need to breed any 2 different hive bees , such as Forest and Meadows until you get a common princess and a common drone. Breed these together a few times to get some spare drones. Then breed the common drones to hive bees until you get a cultivated princess and drone. If you are willing to spend a lot of power Gendustry can bypass the random chance. Build a Mutagen Producer and supply it with power and redstone. Place a Mutatron next to it and supply it with power. Placing a princess and a drone in the Mutatron will give you a 100% chance of getting a pure mutation at the cost of power and liquid mutagen. The Advanced Mutatron will allow you to pick which of the possible mutations you get from bees or trees with multiple mutation chances. The Mutatron also ignores biome and specialty mutation restrictions. So yes you can get a Jaded Bee.
