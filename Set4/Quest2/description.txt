Bees can be a useful way of getting resources without haveing to mine or process stone looking for tiny bits of ores. To get started with bees you will need to lure a few to you. Start by making a squeezer from Forestry. You can power the squeezer with a conduit connected to a dynamo or generator. The conduit will convert the RF into the MJ needed by the squeezer.  Squeeze seeds or nuts to obtain seed oil. Combine a hay bale and some string to make an Artificial Hive.
