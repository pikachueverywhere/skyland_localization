Using a fluiduct move the seed oil from the squeezer to an Ex Nihilo Barrel. Right click the barrel of seed oil with an Artificial Hive to obtain a Scented Hive. Scented hives will lure bees to them depending on where they are placed. Meadows bees will come if there are flowers in a Plains biome. Forest bees like Forest Biomes and lots of leaves. All of thehive bees have special things they want before they are willing to move in. If it takes too long for bees to move in the hive will need to be dipped in seed oil again.
