You may have noticed a lot of different fluids piling up around your base. Sewage, sludge, mob essence and fuel everywhere in tanks and buckets. Extra Cells will allow you to organize this fluid and store it in your AE system. You can import fluids and export them to dynamos and generators and even craft with them either in the AE crafting terminal or in cyclic assemblers and fluicrafters. The fluid collection quests base their ammounts off the largest size of the EC fluid storage drives.
