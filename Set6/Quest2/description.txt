The Jaded one has only one vice. Her addiction to purple... She just adores it. To get on her good side, so she'll help you on your quest, you must provide all things purple. Purple Stained Glass to provide a vision of purple. Buckets of Molten Manyulyn so she can slay her enemies with purple weapons. Purple Dye to paint the road she walks on. Amaranth Planks and Purple Clay to build her summer home. Purple Wool, Purple Bricks, Purple Planks and Purple Candles for all the decoration she requires and finally  Purple Pearls for her jewelry. In return she'll award you with something very special....
