Once you have extra power you may want to look into automated mining options. In this pack there are 2. The Laser drill from MFR and the Ender Quarry from Extra Utilities. the Laser drill needs to be pointed at the void and will work better if it is at y level 128+. It requires at least one Laser Drill Precharger pointed at it. The power is supplied to the drill through the pre-charger. One precharger can use up to 5000 RF per tick. A single lasre drill can be powered by up to 4 prechargers. DO NOT STAND IN THE LASERS.  The other option is an Ender Quarry. The ender quarry will require a piece of iridium ore which you can find very very rarely in the nether or as an output from the laser drill. The enderquarry will remove all ores in an area outlined by fences. It requires RF to power it. Both machines will need a chest on top to put items into. Those items can be removed using and item duct and put into a tesseract for cross dimensional transport. Different laser foci can be added to the laser drill to increase the chance of getting specific ores. Different colors of laser focus will increase the chance of different ores.
