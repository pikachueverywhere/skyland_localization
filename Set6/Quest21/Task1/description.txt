The Molecular Assembler is created from a frame of containment walls. The sides are filled with heat vents and the center is filled with a mix of crafting cpu's and pattern providers. Placing a coded pattern inside the pattern provider of a correctly formed Molecular Assembler will allow you system to craft that item on command. The smallest ME Assembler is 3x3x3 with room for 1 pattern provider.
