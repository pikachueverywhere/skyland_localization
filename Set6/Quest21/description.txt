Through the use of strange science and possibly dark magic the Organized One has created a system that allows you to store items in a digital format, send them out to machines for processing bring them back and then craft them into new components and resources to be sent out and used to expand your factory. Once you have a basic AE storage system in place you may want to consider adding a Molecular Assembler. This mulit-block device will allow you to use coded patterns to craft items auto-magicaly. Interfaces will allow you to tell various machines to process sand into glass or create tesseracts on command.
