As you start gathering items you may notice that basic chests quickly become cluttered and overflowing. Iron chests provide a bit more room but are still not as useful for neat and orderly sorting. Barrels from JABBA will be the first items you can easily make for sorting and storing materials in large quantities. JABBA barrels can be upgraded to hold more materials, emit redstone signals when full and even to void items that won't fit in the current space. You can lock a JABBA barrel by sneak- right clicking on it. If it is empty when it is locked it will not accept any items. If it has an item in it when locked then even if the items are removed it will only accept replacments of that item into its storage space. The barrels can be moved when full through the use of a dolly. To upgrade the storage ammount of a barrel you will need to apply a structural upgrade and a storage upgrade.
