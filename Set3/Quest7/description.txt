Flight is not just for ghasts and blazes. You too can fly with some effort. Thaumcraft adds a harness fueled by potentia, Blood Magic gives you the Sigil of Air to fly powered by the lives of slain foes. And Simply Jetpacks adds flight through technology. The lowest level of Jetpack is powered by a simple potato. Unsurprisingly this jetpack is not very safe. Though if you happen to have potatoes it might be worth donating a few potato jetpacks to your local zombie population. The Derpy one is scared of flying after his experience with the potato jetpack. Prove to him that safe flight is possible by crafting a safer jetpack.
