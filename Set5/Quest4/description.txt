To start Blood Magic you will need to use the Sacrificial Orb to siphon 10 hearts worth of life essence in the Blood Altar. Throw a diamond in the center to create a Weak Blood Orb. Orbs store life essence for powering spells and rituals. Be careful, until you have a mob farm and sacrifice runes in place you will need to use magic sparingly or you may die. Patience is a virtue.
