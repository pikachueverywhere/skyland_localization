You may have noticed a minor lack of infused stone on this map. You may also be wondering how you are supposed to get shards for crafting Thaumcraft recipes. Luckily enough we at "Evil Sky Overlords" thought you might whine about that and Zero kindly made it possible. Take a hammer from Ex Nihilo or Ex Aquilo and hit blocks to produce shards at an admittedly rather small drop rate. The blocks to hit are: Obsidian, TNT, Ice, Grass, Sandstone Slabs (stacked on top of each other) and Netherrack.
