The Weak Blood Orb is not going to hold enough power to cast or craft more complex rituals and spells. You will need to create better blood orbs by upgrading your altar to store more life energy and crafting better orbs. Throwing a gold block in an altar with 30k life power gathered from either yourself or others will generate a Magician's Blood Orb.
